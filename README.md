## Usage Instructions
Basically just look at the JS pseudocode and finish it off.
The CSS could also use a bit of work.
Some work done on the grid layout of elements would benefit the UI greatly.

## Known Issues
Other than only being half done, she's not a bad piece of art.

### Conclusion
A finished product is always better!
